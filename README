So it all started when i was needed to get the version of WhiteMagic.
I 'bidalty' the soap4r gem but it dosnt handle full session so I've started to implement my own soap wraper for ruby .

After Ive started to work I've notice more fetchers that I wanted but the gem could not do ( authonication , read complex wsdl and more)

I will be very glad if you will find bugs and help me extend the framework
